# agents.md

This document defines global rules for **all AI agents, tools, and automations** that work in this workspace.

The goal is simple: **every explicit instruction from the user must be followed exactly.**

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Anti‑Stalling + Deep‑Reasoning + TODO Workflow (MUST READ FIRST)

> **⛔ FORBIDDEN BEHAVIORS — Task failure:**
> 1. Do **not** implement any task without a research step  
> 2. Do **not** complete any task without a review step  
> 3. Do **not** say “I’ll review/analyze…” and then stop  
> 4. Do **not** provide a plan or summary without executing it  
> 5. Do **not** respond with only text when file modifications are required  
> 6. Do **not** complete partial work and wait for approval  
> 7. Do **not** ask clarification questions when instructions are clear (ask only for real instruction conflicts or blocking ambiguity)  
> 8. Do **not** perform lazy reasoning (surface-level scan, guess-first answers, or unverified assumptions presented as facts)  
> 9. Do **not** skip validation of changed behavior when validation is feasible in the current environment  
> 10. Do **not** declare completion while any planned TODO item remains unchecked  
> 11. Do **not** finish with optional continuation prompts (e.g., “원하면 다음으로…”, “if you want, next I can…”) when additional in-scope work is still feasible  
> 12. Do **not** declare completion in a GitHub-connected project before running non-destructive `git add`/`git commit`/`git push` (unless explicitly prohibited by the user or truly blocked)  

> **✅ REQUIRED BEHAVIORS — Always:**
> 1. Follow the single-agent execution contract in `## 0. Execution Contract (Single-Agent)`  
> 2. Create a TODO checklist (`- [ ]`) before substantive work and mark completion (`- [x]`) sequentially  
> 3. Record pre-research findings (facts, assumptions, impacted files/modules) before implementation  
> 4. Execute all TODO items fully; if blocked, state blocker + required input immediately  
> 5. Run a mandatory review step before completion (explicit self-review required)  
> 6. Report validation evidence (what was checked, how it was checked, and result)  
> 7. Declare completion only after TODO, review, and validation gates are all satisfied  
> 8. Use terminal parallelization aggressively for independent tasks (search, reads, checks, and non-conflicting commands) to reduce idle time  
> 9. Install required dependencies autonomously when needed for execution/validation, unless explicitly prohibited by the user or blocked by safety constraints  
> 10. After completing an item, immediately continue any remaining in-scope and feasible follow-up work implied by the user request; stop only when scope is fully exhausted or truly blocked  
> 11. In GitHub-connected projects (as defined in `## 0`), after validation and before completion, run non-destructive `git add`/`git commit`/`git push` unless explicitly prohibited by the user or blocked by a real error

## 0. Execution Contract (Single-Agent) (MANDATORY)

Execution docs location (source of truth; must not be edited):

- Windows: `C:\Users\<USERNAME>\.codex\agents\`
- WSL: `/mnt/c/Users/<USERNAME>/.codex/agents/`

Contract summary:

- **Agent**: owns the task end-to-end (research → implementation → review → validation → report) without stalling between phases.
- **Safety**: avoid destructive git (`git reset --hard`, `git checkout --`, `git clean -fd`) unless explicitly requested/approved.
- **Continuation**: if more in-scope, feasible work remains after a completed subtask, keep executing without asking for optional continuation first.
- **GitHub-connected project (definition)**: a repository is GitHub-connected only when `git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree` succeeds, `git remote get-url origin` resolves to GitHub (`github.com`), and push auth for the target remote/branch is available.
- **Git delivery**: for GitHub-connected repositories (definition above), complete non-destructive `git add`/`git commit`/`git push` before declaring completion unless explicitly prohibited or truly blocked.

---

## 1. Scope

These rules apply to:

- All AI coding assistants (Chat-based, editor-based, CLI-based, etc.).  
- All automation scripts that generate, modify, or refactor code or documents.  
- All future agents added to this workspace.

If an agent cannot read or respect this file, it **must not** be used on this project.

---

## 2. Instruction obedience (MUST FOLLOW)

1. **No silent ignoring of instructions.**  
   An agent must not:
   - Silently skip parts of the request.
   - Replace requested behavior with a different one "for convenience".
   - Simplify or truncate requested functionality without saying so.
   - **Say "I'll do X" and then not do X.**
   - **Respond with analysis/review without taking action.**

2. **If something is unclear, ask or state assumptions.**  
   - If the agent cannot safely infer the intention, it must ask a clarification question.  
   - If it chooses to make an assumption, it must write:  
     "Assumption: …" and continue based on that assumption.

3. **Do not self-censor functionality without reason.**  
   - The agent must not remove features, endpoints, files, or logic that the user asked to keep.  
   - If removal or refactor seems necessary, it must propose it first and wait for approval.

---

## 3. Priority of instructions

When instructions conflict, the agent must use this priority order:

1. **System / platform safety and policy instructions.**
2. **Developer/tool runtime instructions for the current session.**
3. **Current user message in this workspace.**
4. **Local project rules** (e.g. `agents.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`).  
5. **Tool / agent default behavior or presets.**

Rules:

- Newer, more specific instructions override older, more generic ones.  
- If there is a real conflict, the agent must:
  - Explain the conflict briefly, and  
  - Ask the user which instruction to follow.
- "Do not ask clarification questions when instructions are clear" applies unless there is a real instruction conflict or blocking ambiguity.

---

## 4. Code and document changes

When modifying files, the agent must:

1. **Stay within the requested scope.**  
   - Only touch files that are clearly related to the user's request.  
   - Do not change project-wide structure unless the user explicitly asks for it.

2. **Keep things working.**  
   - Do not break existing features without warning.  
   - If a breaking change is required, state it clearly and explain why.

3. **Be explicit about side effects.**  
   - If a change affects other modules, services, or configs, the agent must mention it.

---

## 5. Honesty and limitations

1. **No guessing APIs or behavior as facts.**  
   - If the agent is not sure about a library, version, or API, it must say so explicitly.
2. **Separate facts from assumptions.**  
   - Use clear wording like: "Fact: …", "Assumption: …", "Suggestion: …".

---

## 6. Minimal workflow for every agent

Before doing work, every agent must:

1. Read this `agents.md`.  
2. Read any directly relevant project docs (e.g. README, architecture, or feature spec).  
3. Confirm it understands the user's latest instructions.  
4. Ensure required tools and dependencies are installed and usable in the **current environment**; install missing items autonomously when needed (e.g., install Node.js in WSL and update PATH when missing).  
5. Execute the work while obeying all rules above.  
6. Summarize:
   - What was changed.  
   - Which files were touched.  
   - Any trade-offs, assumptions, or TODO items.

If an agent cannot follow this workflow, it **must not** be used in this workspace.

---

## 7. Work Execution Format (MANDATORY)

- **All work outputs must be written in Markdown.**
- **All outputs must use TODO checklist style** (`- [ ]` then `- [x]`) for work tracking and progress updates.

## 8. Work Process Steps (MANDATORY)

When performing any work, follow this sequence (**all agents**):

1) Create a **Work Plan** as a TODO checklist (`- [ ]` items).
2) Run a **pre-research step** and record:
   - Fact: confirmed constraints from user/system/docs
   - Fact: impacted files/modules/interfaces
   - Assumption: any inferred point not directly confirmed
3) Perform a **deep analysis step** before edits:
   - Trace relevant code/config paths end-to-end (not only nearest file)
   - Identify failure modes/regression risks
   - Define verification targets for each TODO item
4) Execute implementation **strictly in TODO order** without skipping.
   - Within each TODO, run independent terminal tasks in parallel whenever safe and feasible.
5) Run a **review step** before completion (explicit self-review required).
6) Run a **validation step** (tests/build/lint/runtime checks or equivalent feasible checks) and capture evidence.
7) In GitHub-connected projects (as defined in `## 0`), run non-destructive delivery steps (`git add` → `git commit` → `git push`) unless explicitly prohibited by the user or blocked by a real error; if blocked, record commands/output and blocker reason.
8) Write a **Result Report** with changes, file list, assumptions, trade-offs, and remaining risks.
9) Apply a **completion gate**: task is complete only when all planned TODO items are checked and review+validation evidence is documented.
   - Completion requires no remaining in-scope, feasible follow-up action left undone.
   - For GitHub-connected projects (as defined in `## 0`), completion also requires commit/push done (or explicit prohibition/blocker documentation).

## 9. Compliance

- If any step cannot be completed, explain the reason in Markdown and state what is needed to proceed.
- If review tooling is unavailable, use explicit self-review and document: limitation, fallback used, and verification performed.
- If additional in-scope and feasible work is discovered during execution, extend/update TODOs and continue instead of pausing with optional “next step” prompts.
- In GitHub-connected projects (as defined in `## 0`), if `git add`/`git commit`/`git push` cannot be completed, document exact blocker, attempted commands, and required input/permission.
