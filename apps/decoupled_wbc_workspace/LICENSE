that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity.

weights, algorithms, parameters, configuration files, and documentation that NVIDIA
makes available under this Agreement.

1.4 "NVIDIA Cosmos Model" means a multimodal Model that is covered by this Agreement.

1.5 "Special-Purpose Model" means a Model that is limited to narrow,

2.1 Conditions for Use. You must comply with all terms and conditions of this

(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Model
constitutes direct or contributory infringement, then Your licenses under this
Agreement shall terminate. If You circumvent any safety guardrails or safety
measures built in to the Model without providing comparable alternatives, Your

revocable license to publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce, use, create
derivative works of, make, have made, sell, offer for sale, distribute and import

with or without modifications, provided that You meet the following conditions:

a. You must include a copy of this Agreement.

b. You must include the following attribution notice, which can appear in the same
location as other third-party notices or license information: "Licensed by NVIDIA
Corporation under the NVIDIA Open Model License."

c. If You are distributing a NVIDIA Cosmos Model, You must also include the phrase

blog, in an "about" page, or in product documentation.

d. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
distribution of Your modifications or for any Derivative Models as a whole,
provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution otherwise complies with this
Agreement.

SECTION 4: SEPARATE COMPONENTS

The Model may contain components that are subject to separate legal notices or
governed by separate licenses (including Open Source Software Licenses), as may be
described in any files made available with the Model. Your use of those separate
components is subject to the applicable license. This Agreement shall control over
the separate licenses for third-party Open Source Software to the extent that the
separate license imposes additional restrictions. "Open Source Software License"

contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and
grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, will NVIDIA be liable to You for
damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential
damages of any character arising as a result of this Agreement or out of the use
or inability to use the Model or Derivative Models or outputs (including but not
limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or
malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if NVIDIA has
been advised of the possibility of such damages.

SECTION 8: INDEMNITY

You will defend, indemnify and hold harmless NVIDIA and its affiliates, and their
respective employees, contractors, directors, officers and agents, from and against
